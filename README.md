# Clarity & Peace

Clarity & Peace is your personal companion for stress management and well-being. This application helps you track your stress levels, provides personalized AI-driven insights, and guides you through calming breathing exercises.

## üåä Application Flow & Features

The application provides a seamless journey for users to manage their well-being:

1.  **Authentication:** Users start by signing up or signing in on the **Login Page**. The system uses Supabase for secure authentication.
2.  **Dashboard:** After logging in, users land on the **Dashboard**, which serves as a central hub with quick links to all major features.
3.  **Stress Tracking:** Users navigate to the **Stress Tracker** to log their current stress level (from 1 to 5) and add optional notes. This is the primary way users input data into the system.
4.  **Guided Exercises:** If a user records a high stress level, they are prompted to begin an **AI-Guided Breathing Exercise**. These sessions are dynamically tailored to the user's reported stress, featuring a calming voice, personalized guidance, and configurable background music.
5.  **Review & Reflect:** Users can review their past entries in the **History** tab or on the **Calendar View**, which provides a color-coded overview of their stress patterns over time.
6.  **AI Insights:** On the **AI Insights** page, users can generate a detailed analysis of their stress data. The AI provides personalized recommendations, identifies patterns, and offers encouragement.
7.  **Profile Management:** The **Profile Page** allows users to update their name (used for personalizing the AI's guidance) and change their password.
8.  **Admin Panel:** A secure **Admin Dashboard** is available exclusively for the admin user (`clarityandpeace@pxdmail.com`) to monitor app usage, manage users, configure exercise music, and run system diagnostics.

*   **`supabase/functions/`:**
    *   **`generate-speech`:** Generates an MP3 audio stream from text using the OpenAI API.
    *   **`generate-breathing-guidance`:** Generates personalized, calming text for the breathing exercises.
    *   **`analyze-stress`:** Generates a summary and recommendations based on a user's stress history.
    *   **`admin-service`:** A secure function for admin actions, using the service role key to bypass RLS for fetching all user data and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

First, ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and a package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    *   Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Go to Project Settings -> API and copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
        ```
    *   **For AI Features & Admin Dashboard:** You need to set up an OpenAI API key and Supabase Service Role Key as secrets in your Supabase project.
        *   Go to your Supabase project dashboard -> Edge Functions -> Manage Secrets.
        *   Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.
        *   Add a new secret named `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with your Supabase Service Role Key (found under Project Settings -> API -> Project API keys).
    *   **Database Schema:** Ensure your Supabase database has the necessary tables (`profiles`, `stress_entries`, `background_music`, `exercise_music_settings`) and RLS policies configured.
    *   **Edge Functions:** The application relies on several Supabase Edge Functions. These are automatically deployed when you make changes to the `supabase/functions` directory.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
