## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

First, ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm/yarn/pnpm/bun installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd clarity-peace
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    *   Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Go to Project Settings -> API and copy your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
        ```
    *   **For AI Features & Admin Dashboard:** You need to set up an OpenAI API key and Supabase Service Role Key as secrets in your Supabase project.
        *   Go to your Supabase project dashboard -> Edge Functions -> Manage Secrets.
        *   Add a new secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.
        *   Add a new secret named `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with your Supabase Service Role Key (found under Project Settings -> API -> Project API keys).
    *   **Database Schema:** Ensure your Supabase database has the necessary tables (`profiles`, `stress_entries`, `background_music`, `exercise_music_settings`) and RLS policies configured. The application expects these to be in place.
    *   **Edge Functions:** The application relies on several Supabase Edge Functions (`admin-service`, `generate-speech`, `generate-breathing-guidance`, `test-openai-key`). These are automatically deployed when you make changes to the `supabase/functions` directory.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
